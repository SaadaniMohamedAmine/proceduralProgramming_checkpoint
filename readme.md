In this repistory,you will find the resolution of the checkpoint for the chapter "Procedural programming" .
-The statement:
    Name: Dot product
Description: 
 1-   Write a procedure, called dot_product which calculates in the variable ps, the dot(scalar) product of v1 and v2 (v1 and v2 are vectors of IR)
      Write an algorithm which determines, for n pairs of given vectors, whether two vectors of given IR are orthogonal, by calling the procedure defined in the previous question. The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is zero.
2-    Modify the previous algorithm if you use a dot_product function instead of a procedure.
